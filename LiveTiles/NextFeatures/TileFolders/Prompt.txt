I need a brand new feature: tilefolders.

Tilefolders will be special tiles hosting other tiles inside!

The tiles inside a tilefolder will be displayed in a mosaic, each having a size of 33px (both width and height).

A tilefolder can host an unlimited amount of tiles.
But it will display as mosaic only up to 9 tiles.

But how a tilefolder will be created? I'll explain!

Currently, when you drag a tile into another, they'll be reorganized only when you drop.
This will give the opportunity to trigger the formation of a tilefolder!
